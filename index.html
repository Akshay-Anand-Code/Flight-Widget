    <!-- Meta Charset is what determines 
        how text is transmitted and stored.
        This text data is usually converted
        to binary first and then there needs
        to be a kind of cipher that connects
        characters with their correct binary
        equivalents.
        
        charset attribute specifies which character
        encoding to use. HTML5 suggests to go with
        UTF-8 as it covers all character and symbols 
        in the world.
